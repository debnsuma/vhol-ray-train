    "# Get Started with PyTorch FSDP2 and Ray Train: A Complete Guide\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will show you how to train large models that don't fit in a single GPU's memory using PyTorch's Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP2) with Ray Train. FSDP2 enables model sharding across multiple GPUs and nodes, significantly reducing memory footprint compared to standard Distributed Data Parallel (DDP).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you:\n",
    "1. Learn how FSDP2 shards model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across workers\n",
    "2. Configure memory optimization techniques: CPU offloading, mixed precision, and resharding strategies\n",
    "3. Use PyTorch Distributed Checkpoint (DCP) for efficient checkpointing of sharded models\n",
    "4. Profile GPU memory usage with PyTorch's memory snapshot API\n",
    "5. Load the trained model for inference\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is FSDP2?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP2)](https://docs.pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/FSDP_tutorial.html) is PyTorch's native solution for training large models that exceed single GPU memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "> FSDP2 shards model parameters, gradients, and optimizer states across data-parallel workers. During the forward pass, parameters are all-gathered for computation, then re-sharded. This enables training models that are much larger than what fits on a single GPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "FSDP2 is a significant improvement over FSDP1:\n",
    "- **Per-parameter sharding**: Chunks each parameter on dim-0 across workers (vs. flattening/concatenating in FSDP1)\n",
    "- **DTensor integration**: Better support for tensor parallelism and multi-dimensional parallelism\n",
    "- **Relaxed constraints**: Handles frozen parameters more naturally\n",
    "- **Communication-free state dicts**: Sharded state dicts without collective communication\n",
    "\n",
    "## When to Use FSDP2?\n",
    "\n",
    "Use FSDP2 when:\n",
    "- Your model doesn't fit in a single GPU's memory even with gradient checkpointing\n",
    "- You want native PyTorch integration (no external dependencies)\n",
    "- You need fine-grained control over sharding strategies\n",
    "- You're building custom training loops with PyTorch's ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "For comparison with DeepSpeed (another memory optimization solution), see the [DeepSpeed tutorial](./DeepSpeed_RayTrain_Tutorial.ipynb) in this folder."

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we learned how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Configure FSDP2** with memory optimization strategies:\n",
    "   - CPU offloading for reduced GPU memory\n",
    "   - Mixed precision (FP16) for faster training\n",
    "   - Resharding after forward pass\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integrate with Ray Train** for distributed training:\n",
    "   - `TorchTrainer` for multi-GPU/multi-node training\n",
    "   - Automatic process group initialization\n",
    "   - Fault tolerance with checkpoint recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use PyTorch Distributed Checkpoint (DCP)**:\n",
    "   - Sharded saving for parallel I/O\n",
    "   - Automatic resharding on load\n",
    "   - Model consolidation for inference\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Profile GPU memory** using PyTorch's memory snapshot API\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scale up**: Try more workers or larger models\n",
    "- **Hybrid parallelism**: Combine FSDP2 with tensor/pipeline parallelism\n",
    "- **Production deployment**: Use cloud storage (S3, GCS) for checkpoints\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter tuning**: Integrate with Ray Tune\n",
    "- **Try DeepSpeed**: See the [DeepSpeed tutorial](./DeepSpeed_RayTrain_Tutorial.ipynb) for an alternative approach\n",
